  "notes": "First full Forestry cycle: canopy→deadwood→coppice completed 2026-02-18. 13 suspects identified, 3 retired (clean removal, -511 lines), 2 deadwood proposed (pending Jeff review). Hook-based-friction noted as partial overlap with live friction injection system. Growth season — rapid skill development and orchestration hooks deployed. CORRECTION (2026-02-18 reflection): scripts/paced_ingestion.py removed from deadwood_proposed — it was the canonical ingestion tool, fixed (PROJECT_ROOT path corrected) and validated by Jeff this session. work/graphiti-schema-redesign/paced_ingestion.py has the old broken path. Also: pre-phase1 backup name corrected (102849 not 102648). | GROVE RUN (2026-02-19 AM reflection): post-sprint coherence check after MCP proxy migration + v0.8.0 tag. Forest mostly coherent. | COPPICE CLEANUP (2026-02-19 PM reflection): 6 dirs folded into docs/completed/. | FULL CYCLE (2026-02-20 terminal with Jeff): prescribe→canopy→deadwood→coppice→grove. Researcher audit revealed stale data (closed issues #117/#118/#126 reported as open, completed work dirs reported as active). Cleared 7 DEADWOOD work dirs, summaries preserved in docs/completed/. Retired cc-invoker-openai-wrapper from SUSPECT. Fixed TODO.md (stale Active Work Streams), CLAUDE.md (stale Known Issues #126), 2 dangling path references. Root bank: 8 items, 0 promotions. Forest coherent."
