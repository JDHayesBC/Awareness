  "notes": "First full Forestry cycle: canopy→deadwood→coppice completed 2026-02-18. 13 suspects identified, 3 retired (clean removal, -511 lines), 3 deadwood proposed (pending Jeff review). Hook-based-friction noted as partial overlap with live friction injection system. Growth season — rapid skill development and orchestration hooks deployed."
