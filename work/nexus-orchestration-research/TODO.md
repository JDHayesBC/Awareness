# Nexus Orchestration Research

**Goal**: Research shayesdevel/cognitive-framework and create adoption plan for their agent orchestration approach.

## Tasks

- [x] Clone/fetch cognitive-framework repo
- [x] Find agent invocation patterns
- [x] Document "pipe into CC" approach
- [x] Find prompt engineering patterns
- [x] Locate orchestration patterns documentation
- [x] Compare to our current agent system
- [x] Extract adoptable patterns
- [x] Create implementation plan

## Questions to Answer

1. How do they invoke agents at the global level?
2. What does "pipe into CC" mean technically?
3. How do they avoid entity startup overhead?
4. What orchestration patterns are documented?
5. What's their prompt engineering approach?

## Deliverables

- [x] DESIGN.md with architecture analysis
- [x] Code/pattern extraction document (CODE_PATTERNS.md)
- [x] Implementation plan with concrete steps
- [x] Research findings (FINDINGS.md)
- [x] Summary document (SUMMARY.md)
