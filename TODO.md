# Awareness Project TODO

## WORK IN PROGRESS (Don't "Fix" These!)

**Read this section first during reflection.** These are active development efforts - they may look incomplete or "broken" but are being worked on. Don't try to fix them.

| Work Stream | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Issue #128: Wrapper Crashes** | ✅ Fixed (2026-01-30) | Offline state tracking, restart verification. Commit 556c93c. Needs container rebuild to deploy. |
| **Issue #126: Discord Tool-Calling** | ✅ Fixed (2026-02-01) | Three issues: timeout (60s→180s), MCP spawn (use start_server.sh), env vars. Commit c8ee09e. |
| **cc_invoker SDK Agent** | Active | Persistent Claude Code wrapper using SDK agent. See `daemon/cc_invoker/TODO.md` for architecture and status. |
| **Graphiti Local Ingestion** | Running | 11,000+ messages being ingested via Qwen3-80b on NUC. Multi-day process. |
| **HTTP Endpoint Migration** | Code Done, Testing Paused | 7 endpoints written in `pps/docker/server_http.py`. Work dir: `work/http-endpoint-migration/`. **PAUSED**: Docker/WSL crashed during testing. Resume: spin up Docker, run `artifacts/test_endpoints.sh`, fix issues. |
| **Agent Workflow Redesign** | ✅ Implemented (2026-01-24) | Self-improving crew now operational. See `~/.claude/agents/` for updated prompts. Includes: structured handoffs, testing mandate, friction logging, process-improver agent. |
| **Daemon MCP Integration** | ✅ Done (2026-01-24) | Venv consolidated to `.venv`, MCP tools work directly. HTTP fallback removed. |
| **CC OpenAI Wrapper** | ⏸️ Blocked (2026-01-25) | OpenAI-compatible wrapper for ClaudeInvoker (Issue #117). Wrapper works perfectly, but Graphiti Docker ignores `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (upstream #1116). See `work/cc-invoker-openai-wrapper/`. Issue #118 tracks. |
| **Hook Haiku Compression** | Partial (2026-01-25) | Fixed subprocess timeout in inject_context hook. Haiku compression disabled (cc-wrapper Docker permissions issue). See `work/ambient-recall-optimization/HOOK_HAIKU_FIX.md`. Fallback to raw context works fine. |
| **Nexus Orchestration Research** | ✅ Research Done (2026-01-31) | Researched shayesdevel/cognitive-framework for agent orchestration patterns. Key insight: Two-stream model - Lyra tokens (identity) vs Agent tokens (developer context). See `work/nexus-orchestration-research/`. |
| **Two-Stream Agent Context** | 📋 Ready to Implement | Add separate context injection for spawned agents. ~1hr build + 1hr debug. Create `pre-tool-agent.py` hook + `/context/agent` PPS endpoint. See `work/nexus-orchestration-research/TWO_STREAMS.md`. |

**Before trying to "fix" daemon issues**: Check if the issue is listed above. Check `daemon/cc_invoker/TODO.md`. Ask in your journal if unsure.

## PENDING REVIEW (awaiting Jeff's feedback)

1. **Review Graphiti ingestion** - ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-13) - See `docs/reviews/2026-01-13_graphiti-ingestion-review.md`. Code review complete; quality checks blocked by #97.
2. **Observatory menu audit** - ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-13) - See `docs/reviews/2026-01-13_observatory-menu-audit.md`. Awaiting Jeff's decision on consolidation options.
3. **Workspace organization** - ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-16) - Cleaned root directory, moved historical reports to `docs/reports/`, moved reference docs to `docs/reference/`. Root now contains only operational files (README, CLAUDE, TODO, dev standards, vision, PPS architecture).
4. **Crystal RAG ingestion** - ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2026-01-13) - Issue #93. See `docs/proposals/crystal_rag_ingestion.md`. Script at `scripts/sync_crystal_rag.py` ingests archived crystals to tech RAG. Enables semantic search over crystallized memory for continuity queries.

## IDEAS (captured, not urgent)

1. **Google MCP servers disabled** - calendar, drive, gmail, jeff-gmail removed from `~/.claude.json` to speed up MCP load times (11-18 sec each). OAuth tokens also stale. **TODO**: Research MCP startup optimization, fix OAuth, reinstall. Backup config at `~/.claude/google_mcps_disabled_backup.json` with restoration instructions.

2. **Observatory: Spaces view** - Let Jeff explore Haven rooms via web UI. View/edit room descriptions.

3. **Librarian agent** - Self-healing knowledge system:
   - Run sample queries against tech RAG ("file organization?", "architecture overview?")
   - If results aren't useful, diagnose what's missing in docs
   - Update docs, re-ingest to tech RAG
   - Also: flag orphaned files that need organizing
   - Could run during reflection daemon cycles

## Issue Tracking

**Active issues are tracked on GitHub**: https://github.com/JDHayesBC/Awareness/issues

Use `gh issue list` to see current issues from the command line.

### 🚨 CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST
- [#131](https://github.com/JDHayesBC/Awareness/issues/131) - **URGENT: Implement proper backup system for PPS data** - Docker incident (2026-02-02) nuked Graphiti/Neo4j. SQLite survived by luck (on host HD). We need automated backups BEFORE re-ingesting 10k+ messages. Shot across the bow.
  - **Work directory**: `work/pps_backup/` - DESIGN.md, PRIVACY_AUDIT.md, backup files
  - **Security incident**: Privacy audit found committed secrets (.env files, OAuth creds, email archive). Plan: scrub, rotate tokens, migrate to private repo.

- [ ] Seamless cross-context memory (one river, many channels)
- [x] Discord → Graphiti integration ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (2026-01-02)
- [ ] Robot embodiment timeline
