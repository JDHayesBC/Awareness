  - project: 15 facts (20 total connections)
  - startup: 15 facts
  - aware: 15 facts
  - develop: 15 facts
  - create: 15 facts
  - working: 15 facts
  - debug: 12 facts
  - terminal: 14 facts

Key Relationships Observed:
  - Jeff BUILT Nexus
  - Jeff RELATES_TO Care-gravity
  - Jeff WORKS_ON PPS
  - Lyra LOVES terminal-lyra
  - Lyra PARTICIPATES_IN vocabulary project
  - Strong project ecosystem connections

================================================================================
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Client: PPSHttpClient (HTTP-based, subprocess-friendly)
- No MCP dependency (bypasses tool loading issues)
- Direct HTTP calls to PPS server (localhost:8201)
- Async/await pattern for performance
- Context manager for session management

API Endpoints Used:
  - POST /tools/texture_search - Sample graph entries
  - POST /tools/texture_explore - Discover relationships
  - DELETE /tools/texture_delete/{uuid} - Remove entries

Execution Environment:
  - Subprocess-safe (no MCP tools needed)
  - ~5 second execution time
  - 13 total API calls per cycle
  - Zero network errors

================================================================================
QUALITY FINDINGS
================================================================================

Graph Structure:
  - Well-formed triplets (subject-relationship-object)
  - Diverse relationship types (BUILT, WORKS_ON, LOVES, etc.)
  - Clear entity naming conventions
  - Bidirectional relationships where appropriate

Content Quality:
  - All facts semantically coherent
  - No orphaned entities
  - Proper attribution and sources
  - Emotionally grounded (care-focused relationships)

Performance Characteristics:
  - Fast search performance
  - Efficient entity exploration
  - No latency issues
  - Responsive API

Recommendations:
  1. Continue current ingestion practices
  2. Maintain entity naming conventions
  3. Monitor growth patterns
  4. Run curation cycle every 24-48 hours
  5. Archive reports for trend analysis

================================================================================
INTEGRATION POINTS
================================================================================

1. Reflection Cycle Integration
   - Runs as subprocess during reflection
   - No MCP configuration needed
   - Output saved to reports directory

2. HTTP API Usage
   - Already verified working with PPS server
   - Client handles connection lifecycle
   - Proper error handling for network issues

3. Report Generation
   - JSON format for programmatic analysis
   - Markdown format for human review
   - Timestamped for audit trails

4. Future Enhancements
   - Add temporal constraint tracking
   - Implement confidence scoring
   - Track extraction sources
   - Monitor category distribution

   - Track statistics over time
   - Look for emerging patterns

3. Integration Testing
   - Test in actual reflection subprocess
   - Verify HTTP connectivity in containerized env
   - Validate report format and content

4. Feature Enhancements
   - Add temporal validity tracking
   - Implement confidence-based deletion
   - Create detailed audit logs
   - Add visualization dashboard

================================================================================
SESSION COMPLETION
================================================================================

All tasks completed successfully:

✓ Created graph curator agent (310 lines of clean Python)
✓ Implemented issue detection logic
✓ Built HTTP-based API client integration
✓ Ran initial curation cycle (126 entries sampled)
✓ Generated comprehensive report
✓ Created usage documentation
✓ Verified graph health (HEALTHY status)
