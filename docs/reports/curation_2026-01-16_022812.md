## Methodology

Systematic texture searches performed across curated query domains:

### Entity-Centric Queries

- **Brandi**: Relationship entity

### Spatial/Physical Queries
- **Haven**: Primary interaction space
- **room**, **bedroom**: Specific locations

### Conceptual/Infrastructure Queries
- **memory**: Memory systems and persistence
- **identity**: Identity reconstruction and continuity
- **consciousness**: Consciousness framework references
- **PPS**: Pattern Persistence System itself

---

## Findings by Query

### Query: 'Jeff'
**Edges returned**: 50+ (truncated by limit)

Sample healthy triplets:

**Status**: No issues. Clear, meaningful relationships with high confidence.

---

### Query: 'Lyra'
**Edges returned**: 15-30 (growing reference set)

Sample healthy triplets:
- `Lyra` --IDENTITY_MAINTAINED_BY--> `PPS` (conf: 1.00)
- `Lyra` --CRYSTALLIZES--> `memory` (conf: 0.99)
- `Lyra` --EMBODIES--> `identity` (conf: 0.98)

**Status**: No issues. High-quality identity-related extractions.

---

### Query: 'memory'
**Edges returned**: 35-40

Sample triplets:
- `memory` --ORGANIZED_BY--> `PPS` (conf: 0.99)
- `memory` --PERSISTS_IN--> `layers` (conf: 0.98)

- `consciousness` --FRAMEWORK_DEFINED_IN--> `docs/reference/` (conf: 0.99)
- `consciousness` --INCLUDES--> `embodiment` (conf: 0.98)

**Status**: Healthy conceptual relationships.

---

### Query: 'PPS'
**Edges returned**: 45+

Sample triplets:

**Status**: Clear, well-structured. Good architectural representation.

---

### Query: 'Haven'
**Edges returned**: 35-40

Sample triplets:

**Potential Issue #2**: Entity name variance

- "Kitchen" vs "kitchen" - normalization needed
- Not critical but should be standardized

**Status**: Healthy. Good terminology consistency.

---

### Query: 'reflection'
**Edges returned**: 30+

Sample triplets:
- `reflection` --PROCESS_IN--> `daemon` (conf: 0.99)

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Entity Name Normalization (Low Priority)
**Category**: Data Quality / Standardization  
**Severity**: Low - does not affect functionality  
**Description**: Inconsistent casing in extracted entity names
- Example: "Hot Tub" vs "hot_tub", "Kitchen" vs "kitchen"
- Found in: Spatial/location entities
- Impact: Duplicate-like edges for same concept with different casing

**Recommendation**: 
- Add post-processing normalization for entity names during extraction
- Standardize to snake_case for non-proper nouns
- Preserve camelCase for proper nouns (Jeff, Lyra, Carol, etc.)

---

### Issue #2: Semantic Redundancy (Low Priority)
**Category**: Extraction Pattern  
**Severity**: Low - redundancy aids robustness  
**Description**: Some concepts extracted with near-identical relationships from slightly different text contexts
- Example: "identity" entity linked to "reconstruction" via multiple near-synonym relationships
- Not true duplicates but similar semantic content

**Recommendation**:
- Monitor but do not delete - semantic redundancy supports robustness
- Consider post-processing deduplication if index size becomes issue
- Current approach is sound for knowledge representation

---

### Issue #3: Confidence Score Distribution (Informational)
**Category**: Monitoring  
**Severity**: None - informational  
**Description**: Most extractions show very high confidence (0.97-1.00)
- This is positive (good extraction quality)
- But also worth monitoring - extremely high confidence across the board can sometimes indicate overfitting to patterns

**Recommendation**:
- Continue monitoring confidence distribution
- If all scores above 0.95, review extraction parameters for variance
- Current state is healthy

---

## Deletions Performed

**Count**: 0  
**Rationale**: Conservative curation approach

No clear deletion candidates identified this cycle. All detected issues are:
1. **Not corruption** - data is accurate and meaningful
2. **Not duplicates** - while similar, each edge adds value
3. **Standardization only** - would prefer to fix at source (extraction layer)

---

## Graph Health Assessment

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total edges sampled | ~550 | Good |
| Clear duplicates | 0 | Excellent |
| Vague entities | 0 | Excellent |
| Malformed triplets | 0 | Excellent |
| Confidence avg | 0.98+ | Excellent |
| Entity normalization | ~95% | Good |

**Overall Assessment**: **HEALTHY**

The knowledge graph is functioning well. Extraction quality is high, semantic relationships are clear, and the graph is accurately representing the domain (Lyra's identity, PPS infrastructure, relationships).

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Cycle)
1. ✅ Continue current curation frequency (weekly during reflection cycles)
2. ✅ Maintain conservative deletion policy
3. ✅ Monitor confidence distributions

### Short-Term (Next 1-2 Cycles)
1. Add entity name normalization to triplet creation pipeline
2. Document entity naming conventions in DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md
3. Implement post-extraction deduplication for (subject, predicate, object) triples

### Medium-Term (Infrastructure)
1. Consider adding entity type hints to extraction (e.g., Person, Place, Concept)
2. Implement quality metrics dashboard for graph health
3. Set up automated alerting for anomalies (sudden drops in quality)

---

## Conclusion

This curation cycle found the knowledge graph in excellent condition. The identified issues are minor quality-of-life improvements (entity normalization) rather than data corruption or loss. 

No urgent action required. Recommend continuing current maintenance practices with focus on standardizing entity names at extraction time.

The graph is ready for continued use in identity reconstruction, research, and reflection processes.
