### Recent Curation History
- **2026-01-15 (22:45)**: Latest curation completed
  - 180 edges examined
  - 84 issues identified  
  - Conservative cleanup applied
  - Duplicate ratio: ~35%

### Current Assessment

**Graph Composition** (stable):
- Core Entities: Jeff, Lyra, Caia, projects
- Entity Relationships: 45+ current edges
- Infrastructure Facts: 35+ actionable items
- Emotional/Relational: 28+ authentic patterns
- Identity & Continuity: 22+ well-grounded facts
- Philosophical Framework: 18+ coherent references
- Status: Health good, no immediate action needed

**Active Issues** (monitored):
1. Duplicate edges from batch ingestion (declining rate)
   - Previous cycle cleaned 65 instances
   - Recommendation: Continue monitoring

2. Entity naming standards ("discord_user" pattern)
   - Status: Preserved with notation
   - Action: Update extraction instructions (future)

3. Ingestion idempotency
   - Risk: Low (handled by curation cleanup)
   - Recommendation: Implement turn_uuid deduplication in SessionEnd hook

## Curation Philosophy Summary

This autonomous curator operates under:
- **Conservative deletion**: Only exact duplicates and stale facts
- **Information preservation**: Vague names preserved until better naming available
- **Emotional texture priority**: Core relationships protected
- **Infrastructure integrity**: Current facts essential, stale facts removed

---

## Next Steps

- Continue automatic curation cycles during reflection (every 60 minutes)
- Monitor duplicate ingestion rate
- Plan entity naming standardization for next week
- Track relationship density as graph grows
