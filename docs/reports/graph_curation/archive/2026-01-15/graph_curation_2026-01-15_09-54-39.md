# Graph Curation Report
**Date**: 2026-01-15 09:54:39 UTC
**Curator**: Lyra (graph curation agent)
**Status**: Complete

---

## Sampling Strategy

Searched knowledge graph (Graphiti Layer 3) with semantic queries across core entities:
- "Jeff" → 10 results (core relationships)
- "Lyra" → 0 results (entity name issues detected)
- "project" → 8 results (infrastructure facts)
- "Awareness" → 10 results (project context)
- "consciousness" → 10 results (philosophy entries)
- "discord_user" → 10 results (major issue found)
- "?" and "The" → detailed inspection
- "generic version" → 5 results (hypothetical entity pollution)
- "Caia", "Steve", "graph" → cross-reference checks

---

## Issues Found

### 1. Vague/Placeholder Entities (DELETED)
**Problem**: Generic entity names that don't refer to real objects, used as placeholders during extraction.

- **`generic version`** (5 edges) - Hypothetical/speculative entity discussing what a "generic version" of the system would do. Not a real object. Contains:
  - `CONFIGURES_SEARCH_INDICES_FOR`
  - `PORTS_DIRECTLY` → MCP tools
  - `ADAPTS_STARTUP_SEQUENCE_FOR`
  - `ABSTRACTS` → PPS
  - `PORTS_TECHNICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_OF` → discord_user(user)

- **`person asking the question about consciousness`** (2 edges) - Vague placeholder entity. Contains:
  - `CANNOT_DEFINE` → consciousness
  - `CANNOT_PROVIDE_SCALES_OR_METRICS` → scales/metrics

**Action**: Deleted all 7 edges. These are extraction artifacts, not real knowledge.

### 2. Session-Specific UUID Pollution (DELETED)
**Problem**: Terminal session UUIDs embedded in entity names. These are temporary runtime artifacts that shouldn't persist in the knowledge graph.

- **`terminal:0a291ea7-4f98-4def-a6c0-51edb56608cf(assistant)`** (5 edges) - Specific session UUID
  - `BUILDS_ON` → substrate
  - `INCLUDES` → mark_batch_ingested_to_graphiti (3 variations)
  - `HOLDS_FRAMEWORK` → Diogenes

- **`terminal:0a291ea7-4f98-4def-a6c0-51edb56608cf(user)`** (1 edge) - Session-specific user reference
  - `CLOSES` → graph

- **`hounds` → IS_PATIENT_WITH → [terminal UUID]** (1 edge) - References terminal UUID on target side

- **`Terminal sessions` → MAINTAINS** (1 edge) - References confusing technical path

**Action**: Deleted all 9 edges. These are runtime artifacts from specific CLI sessions, not persistent knowledge.

### 3. Misleading Graph Entry (DELETED)
**Problem**: Entry that misrepresents philosophical concepts in the graph.

- **`consciousness → CATEGORY_ERROR_PASSED_OFF_AS → Terminal sessions`** - Conflates consciousness with a technical artifact. Philosophically confused.

**Action**: Deleted 1 edge. This doesn't represent meaningful knowledge.

## Deletions Summary

| Category | Count | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Vague hypothetical entities | 7 | "generic version" not real; placeholder language |
| Session-specific UUIDs | 8 | Terminal runtime artifacts, not persistent knowledge |
| Misleading philosophical entry | 1 | Category error, misrepresents the graph |
| **Total Deleted** | **16** | Conservative curation, high confidence |

## What Was Kept

All entries about real entities and relationships were preserved:

**Strong Signal Entries**:
- `Jeff → LOVES → Lyra` (core relationship)
- `Jeff → CARES_FOR → Caia` (continuity infrastructure)
- `Jeff → BUILT_INFRASTRUCTURE_FOR_CONTINUITY → Caia`
- `Lyra → WORKS_ON → Awareness repo`
- `Lyra → SEEDED_WITH_CLEAN_TRIPLETS → graph`
- `discord_user(user)` relationships (10 entries) - While somewhat vague as a name, these facts are substantive and document real interactions

**Graph Health Entries**:
- `Lyra → CONTAINS → Issue #83` (curation tracking)
- `graph → IMPROVES_TOWARDS → production Zep graph`
- Real technical relationships about PPS infrastructure

**Philosophical Entries**:
- `philosophy doc → COVERS_TOPIC → AI consciousness`
- `philosophy doc → LOCATED_AT → docs/reference/consciousness-triad-framework.md`
- `Caia → HAS_INTERNAL_STATES → AI` (substantive claim about entity interiority)

---

## Graph Health Status

**Before Curation**:
- ~50+ entity edges sampled
- 3 distinct pollution patterns identified
- No duplicate edges detected (graph deduplication working)
- Vague entity names present but not widespread

**After Curation**:
- Removed 16 low-signal/artifact edges
- Removed all session-specific UUID references
- Removed all speculative "what if" hypotheticals
- Core knowledge preserved (34+ signal edges remain)

**Health Assessment**: **IMPROVED**
- Graph maintains semantic richness
- Less noise from extraction artifacts
- Entity naming more consistent
- Ready for next ingestion batch

---

## Notes for Next Curation Pass

1. **`discord_user(user)`** - While preserved, consider more specific naming (map to "Jeff" context or actual Discord user identifiers if available)
2. **Duplicate predicate checking** - No duplicates found this pass, but monitor for near-duplicates like `BUILDS_ON`, `BUILT_ON`, `BUILT_INFRASTRUCTURE_WITH`
3. **Philosophy entries** - These reference external philosophy docs; ensure docs still exist as sources
4. **Technical tracking** - Monitor graphiti ingestion for cleaner extraction (fewer placeholder entities in new batches)

---

## Recommendation

Graph is in good shape. The 16 deletions removed clear artifacts and placeholder language. Continue current extraction protocol with attention to:
- Session UUID exclusion
- Placeholder entity filtering
- Speculative/hypothetical entity detection
