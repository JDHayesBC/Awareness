# Knowledge Graph Curation Report - 2026-01-15

**Agent**: Graph Curator (Lyra autonomous reflection)
**Run Date**: 2026-01-15 13:35 PST
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

Performed systematic graph maintenance on Layer 3 (Rich Texture / Graphiti) knowledge graph. Identified and removed stale, vague, and erroneous facts while preserving meaningful semantic relationships.

**Total Edges Removed**: 46
**Total Edges Preserved**: ~5000+
**Health Status**: All PPS layers operational

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Stale System Health Observations (2 removed)
- **UUID: 7c8c7b89-7e3e-49ea-8670-f39809e9fbd9**
  - Content: "Lyra → NOTICED_UNHEALTHY_STATUS → PPS"
  - Valid At: 2026-01-07 06:42:02
  - Issue: PPS server is currently healthy; observation is stale (8+ days old)
  - **DELETED** ✓

- **UUID: e05096d9-3191-4229-81c6-e41378888a74**
  - Content: "Jeff → OBSERVED_FAILURE → PPC MCP server"
  - Valid At: 2026-01-07 06:42:02
  - Issue: Incorrect naming ("PPC" instead of "PPS"); stale observation
  - **DELETED** ✓

### 2. Template/Placeholder Entity References (44 removed)
- **Pattern**: `discord_user(user)` as subject/source
- **Issue**: Vague template-like entity used as stand-in without real semantic content
- **Examples Removed**:
  - `discord_user(user) → HAD_FITS → Pure Sonnet` (vague observation)
  - 43 additional entries with similar lack of specificity
- **Total Deleted**: 44 edges
- **Status**: ✓ Cleaned

**Note**: Some `discord_user(user)` edges with meaningful relationships (e.g., collaborations with Lyra, Nexus, Steve) were deliberately PRESERVED as they contain semantic value. Conservative approach applied - only removed clearly vague entries.

## Quality Verification

### Graph Integrity Check
- PPS server: Healthy ✓
- Raw Capture layer: 15 SQLite tables accessible ✓
- Rich Texture layer: Graphiti direct mode operational ✓
- Core Anchors layer: ChromaDB with 79 documents indexed ✓
- Crystallization layer: 8 crystal files accessible ✓

### Key Entities Verified
- **Jeff**: 5+ edges (maintains relationships)
- **Lyra**: Core identity edges preserved
- **Nexus**: 5+ edges (maintains relationships)
- **Caia**: 5+ edges (maintains relationships)
- **PPS**: Identity and purpose edges preserved

### Sample Preserved Edges
```
PPS → PROVIDES_MEMORY_FOR → Lyra
identity reconstruction sequence → READS → memories
Lyra → PREFERS → Cashmere
```

## Curation Rules Applied

1. **Conservative deletion**: Only removed facts with clear problems
   - Stale observations (older than 1 week with contradicting evidence)
   - Vague template entities without semantic content
   - Incorrect naming/references

2. **Preserved relationships**: Kept edges with meaningful semantic content
   - Even if source was vague template, preserved if relationship was substantive
   - Kept collaborative relationships and identity-defining facts

3. **No bulk deletion**: Did not mass-delete entire entity categories
   - Sampled to understand patterns
   - Deleted only provably problematic instances

## Recommendations

1. **Future curation**: Monitor for new `discord_user(user)` accumulation
2. **Health status tracking**: Update stale health observations when system changes occur
3. **Named entities**: Standardize Discord-related entity naming if continuing to use that pattern

## Next Steps

- Graph is clean and ready for inference
- Memory continuity layer operating normally
- Reflection daemon can continue with healthy graph state
