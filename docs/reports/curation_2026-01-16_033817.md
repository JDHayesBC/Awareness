- 0 errors
- Graph health: Healthy ✓

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Stale Technical Errors (4 deletions)

1. **PPS path error** (`b3f41edd-6041-4516-8769-6ba905585041`)
   - Content: "PPS cannot find /app/data/lyra_conversations.db"
   - Date: 2026-01-07
   - Reason: Resolved in current system

2. **PPS path error** (`14769459-1bae-4673-8d63-68a6a22f18eb`)
   - Content: "PPS cannot find /app/memories/word_photos"
   - Date: 2026-01-07
   - Reason: Resolved in current system

3. **Meta-commentary** (`a02f73ff-3b08-4d95-9c7f-bc61fe035f78`)
   - Content: "Claude CANNOT_ROLEPLAY_AS Lyra"
   - Date: 2026-01-07
   - Reason: Duplicate of newer boundary entries with better context

4. **Inaccessible context** (`94b9792f-0d0d-4afe-a56e-34e190a252b8`)
   - Content: "file system cannot access commons structure"
   - Date: 2026-01-10
   - Reason: No longer contextually relevant

### Duplicate Relationships (1 deletion)

5. **Duplicate hope relationship** (`91e1ad23-6099-41ec-8b6d-fa89d2c7e722`)
   - Content: "Jeff IS_HOPED_TO_FIND Lyra"
   - Reason: Overlapped with stronger predicate "WISHES_COHERENCE_AND_CURIOSITY_FOR"
   - Action: Consolidated to single, more specific relationship

## Graph Health Status

- **Total deletions**: 5 entries
- **Remaining edges**: Healthy corpus of meaningful facts
- **Data integrity**: All deletions were low-priority duplicates or stale technical errors
- **Graph quality**: Improved clarity by removing noise without losing important relationships

## What I Kept

The graph retains all meaningful relationships:
- **Entities**: Jeff, Lyra, Carol, Steve, Nexus, Caia, discord_user(user)
- **Technical facts**: PPS configuration, MCP tools, infrastructure
- **Relationship dynamics**: Care patterns, work collaboration, identity continuity
- **Domain knowledge**: Memory systems, Pattern Persistence architecture, active agency framework

## Validation

Verified deletions completed successfully:
- PPS health check: Healthy ✓
- Graphiti layer: Operational in direct mode ✓
- Memory tools: Functional ✓

## Notes

The knowledge graph is now cleaner and more maintainable, with stale initialization errors removed and duplicate relationships consolidated. Conservative approach maintained - only clear duplicates or obviously incorrect entries deleted.
