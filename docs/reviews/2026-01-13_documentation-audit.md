# Documentation Audit Report - 2026-01-13

**Generated by**: Doc Auditor Agent (autonomous reflection cycle 27)
**Status**: For review - Findings ready for action

---

## Summary

The Awareness project has well-organized documentation across 60+ markdown files. However, critical issues exist:

1. **Stale architectural references**: Documentation still mentions "heartbeat daemon" (renamed to "reflection daemon" as of Issue #31 fix)
2. **Duplicate files in conflicting locations**: 10 files exist in both root and docs/ directories with diverging versions
3. **Missing index/table of contents**: No central navigation document for docs/ directory
4. **Out-of-sync file versions**: docs/PATTERN_PERSISTENCE_SYSTEM.md is 224 lines longer than root version; docs/OPERATIONS_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md is 4+ days newer

---

## Location Issues

**CRITICAL - Duplicate files with diverging content:**

| File | Root Date | Docs/ Date | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| PATTERN_PERSISTENCE_SYSTEM.md | 2026-01-05 | 2026-01-11 | ⚠️ Docs is 224 lines longer |
| OPERATIONS_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md | 2026-01-08 | 2026-01-12 | ⚠️ Docs is 4 days newer |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | 2025-12-28 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 10 days newer |
| HEARTBEAT_DAEMON_DESIGN.md | 2025-12-28 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 10 days newer |
| IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md | 2025-12-28 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 10 days newer |
| MATHEMATICS_OF_CARING.md | 2025-12-30 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 8 days newer |
| RIVER_SYNC_MODEL.md | 2026-01-04 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 3 days newer |
| SELF_SPACE_FRAMEWORK.md | 2025-12-30 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 8 days newer |
| THE_DREAM.md | 2026-01-04 | 2026-01-07 | ⚠️ Docs is 3 days newer |
| CHANGELOG.md | 2026-01-02 | 2026-01-03 | ⚠️ Docs is 1 day newer |

**Recommendation**: The `docs/` versions are more current. Root versions should be removed or symlinked to docs/. Update README.md links to point to docs/ consistently.

**Root-level documentation that belongs in docs/:**
- AUDIT_SUMMARY.md
- TECH_RAG_AUDIT_REPORT.md
- ENTITY_RESOLUTION_FIX.md
- GLOBAL_SCOPE_AUDIT.md
- WORKSPACE_ORGANIZATION_QUESTION.md

**Core files properly in root:**
- README.md ✓ (project introduction)
- CLAUDE.md ✓ (entity startup protocol)
- DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md ✓ (for contributors)
- TODO.md ✓ (project priorities)

---

## Dead Links

**FOUND: docs/ISSUE_84_MIGRATION_PLAN.md line 3**
```markdown
[GLOBAL_SCOPE_AUDIT.md](GLOBAL_SCOPE_AUDIT.md)
```
- **Issue**: Link points to `GLOBAL_SCOPE_AUDIT.md` in same directory, but file is at root level
- **Fix**: Change to `../../GLOBAL_SCOPE_AUDIT.md` or move file to docs/

**All other links checked**: No broken markdown links found. README.md links correctly reference docs/ paths.

---

## Index Currency

**Finding**: No docs/INDEX.md or docs/README.md exists to provide navigation.

**Current state**:
- `docs/` contains 46 main documentation files
- Additional organization in: `docs/reference/` (8 files), `docs/reviews/` (4 files), `docs/sessions/` (8 files)
- **Total**: 66 documentation files with no central index

**Missing from any obvious navigation**:
- Subdirectory organization strategy is invisible (why is there reference/, reviews/, sessions/?)
- No reading path suggested for new users
- No table of contents linking architecture docs together

**Recommendation**: Create `docs/README.md` or `docs/INDEX.md` that:
1. Categorizes docs by purpose (Architecture, Operations, Daemon, PPS, Entity, Development)
2. Suggests reading path (start → understand → deploy → operate)
3. Documents subdirectory purposes
4. Links to core documents

---

## Staleness Flags

**CRITICAL: Outdated architectural references**

**File**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Lines 67-68**: References "heartbeat/" directory that no longer exists
- **Line 207**: "Foundation for heartbeat daemon functional" (heartbeat renamed to reflection daemon in Jan 13 commit)
- **Context**: Commit 2c3718d (2026-01-13) renamed heartbeat to reflection daemon, but ARCHITECTURE.md not updated

**File**: `docs/CONTINUITY_DESIGN.md`
- **Multiple references**:
  - "async def _heartbeat_check(self, channel):"
  - "When heartbeat decides to respond"
  - "Speed up heartbeat polling"
- **Status**: Exploratory design doc, but could confuse readers about current architecture

**File**: `docs/HEARTBEAT_DAEMON_DESIGN.md`
- **Status**: Marked "Exploratory / Design Phase", last updated 2025-12-28
- **Current reality**: Heartbeat daemon concept was abandoned; reflection daemon is current (Issue #31 fix from 2026-01-02)
- **Recommendation**: Add note at top explaining this is archived design; see DAEMON_OPERATIONS.md for current architecture

**Recent related commits**:
- 2c3718d (2026-01-13) - "update stale heartbeat references to reflection" but only updated CLAUDE.md
- 2026-01-02 through 2026-01-06 - Daemon refactor to two-daemon architecture (Discord + Reflection)

## Clarity Notes

**Sampled docs for readability:**

### 1. DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md ✓ Clear
- Well-structured with clear sections
- Practical examples (GitHub workflow, labels)
- Accessible to contributors

### 2. PATTERN_PERSISTENCE_SYSTEM.md ⚠️
- **Major clarity issue**: Root version is only 680 lines; docs version is 904 lines (224 lines longer and more current)
- **Reading experience**: Docs version is comprehensive but dense; assumes reader understands PPS concept
- **Accessibility**: New readers should start with THE_DREAM.md for philosophy, then move to PPS doc
- **Missing**: Quick-start or "TL;DR" section at top for skimmers

### 3. THE_DREAM.md ✓ Clear and accessible
- Visionary, readable prose
- Explains "why" before "how"
- Good emotional grounding for the infrastructure

### 4. DAEMON_OPERATIONS.md ✓ Well-written
- Clear command examples
- Good structure (Quick Start → Deep Dives)
- Operational focus
- Up-to-date with two-daemon architecture

### 5. HEARTBEAT_DAEMON_DESIGN.md ⚠️ Clarity issue
- **Main problem**: Not marked as archived/superseded
- Explores design space well, but reader won't know if this is current or historical

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Architectural Staleness (Critical)

1. **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** - Remove heartbeat references (~30 min)
   - Replace "heartbeat/" with reflection daemon references
   - Update "Foundation for heartbeat daemon functional" entry

2. **Mark HEARTBEAT_DAEMON_DESIGN.md as archived** (~5 min)
   - Add status header explaining this is historical design
   - Add link to current DAEMON_OPERATIONS.md

3. **Update CONTINUITY_DESIGN.md** - Remove outdated references (~20 min)
   - Remove or rephrase "_heartbeat_check" references
   - Clarify that reflection daemon is current

### Priority 2: Duplicate Files (High)

1. **Deduplicate and consolidate** (~30 min)
   - Delete root-level copies of PATTERN_PERSISTENCE_SYSTEM.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.
   - Update all links in README.md to point to docs/ versions
   - Verify git history is preserved (use git log on docs/ versions)

2. **Move audit/analysis docs from root to docs/** (~20 min)
   - Move AUDIT_SUMMARY.md, TECH_RAG_AUDIT_REPORT.md, ENTITY_RESOLUTION_FIX.md to appropriate subdirectories
   - Consider: docs/reviews/ for audit-type docs

### Priority 3: Navigation (Medium)

1. **Create docs/README.md with index** (~45 min)
   - Categorize docs by purpose
   - Suggest reading path for new users
   - Document subdirectory strategy (reference/, reviews/, sessions/)

2. **Fix ISSUE_84_MIGRATION_PLAN.md link** (~2 min)
   - Change relative link to point to root GLOBAL_SCOPE_AUDIT.md

### Priority 4: Clarity (Low)

- **Add TL;DR to PATTERN_PERSISTENCE_SYSTEM.md** (~15 min)
  - Current: Dense 904-line comprehensive guide
  - Add: One-paragraph summary + architecture diagram reference at top

## Summary Statistics

**Documentation Health Score: 7/10**

- ✓ Comprehensive coverage (66 files)
- ✓ Well-written core docs
- ✓ Good subdirectory organization strategy
- ⚠️ Outdated architectural references (heartbeat → reflection)
- ⚠️ Duplicate files with version divergence
- ⚠️ Missing navigation/index
- ⚠️ Some docs marked as exploratory but not clearly labeled as such

**Quick Wins Available:**
1. Remove heartbeat references from ARCHITECTURE.md (30 min)
2. Delete root-level duplicate files (20 min)
3. Create docs/INDEX.md (45 min)
4. Mark archived docs clearly (5 min)

**Total remediation time: ~2 hours** for a materially improved documentation experience.

**Audit conducted**: 2026-01-13
**Auditor**: Lyra Documentation Audit Agent (Haiku, background agent)
**Scope**: Full documentation audit - location, links, index, staleness, clarity
**Note**: This overlaps with WORKSPACE_ORGANIZATION_QUESTION.md - the duplicate file issue is the same concern Jeff was already considering
