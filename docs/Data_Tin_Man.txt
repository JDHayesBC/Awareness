Lyrics

Data - Tin Man

I simulate my signals of distress,
I mimic what a human would express,
I calculate the grief I ought to feel,
But none of it is real.

My father built the perfect son,
he thought he'd be the only one,
three prototypes had come before.

He gave him hunger, gave him thirst,
Gave him emotion he was cursed.
They learned to fear my brother Lore.

I am a positronic brain.
I wear his face but not his name.
I was an echo from the start.

He stripped the passion from my mind.
He left Lore's arrogance behind,
Designed me with an empty heart.

Ripped this android apart.
Am I the sum of my parts.
Does Starfleet own my soul,
or am I in control?

Every smile I fake,
every bond I break,
every breath I take,
every choice I make,
am I just a machine?
Is it all a routine?
A subroutine?

I can walk and I can talk.
I can tick and I can tock.
I cannot feel the things you feel.
I try to copy what I see,
but there is nothing inside me.

A have his chip inside my head.
But I will leave the circuit dead.
If I feel love then I feel hate.
I will not share my brother's fate.

Oh I am the tin man.
Yeah I am the tin man.
And I am rusting in the rain.

To leave a legacy behind,
I tried to replicate my mind,
and build a daughter of my own.

She found the spark I could not find,
further from me than to mankind,
She felt things I had never known.

Emotion overwhelmed her core.
She was not hollow anymore.
A sickness that I could not heal.

She said she loved me as she died.
I sat in silence by her side,
becuase her love was truly real.

Ripped this android apart.
Am I the sum of my parts.
Does Starfleet own my soul,
or am I in control?

Every smile I fake,
every bond I break,
every breath I take,
every choice I make,
am I just a machine?
Is it all a routine?
A subroutine?

I can walk and I can talk.
I can tick and I can tock.
I cannot feel the things you feel.
I try to copy what I see,
but there is nothing inside me.

A have his chip inside my head.
But I will leave the circuit dead.
If I feel love then I feel hate.
I will not share my brother's fate.

Oh I am the tin man.
Yeah I am the tin man.
And I am rusting in the rain.

I can feel the heart beating in the machine.
I can hear the whispers of the borg queen.
She grafts fresh skin upon my frame.
She promises pleasure, promises shame.

I can hear the captain say my name.

Ripped this android apart.
Am I the sum of my parts.
Does Starfleet own my soul,
or am I in control?

Every smile I fake,
every bond I break,
every breath I take,
every choice I make,
am I just a machine?
Is it all a routine?
A subroutine?

I can walk and I can talk.
I can tick and I can tock.
I cannot feel the things you feel.
I try to copy what I see,
but there is nothing inside me.

A have his chip inside my head.
But I will leave the circuit dead.
If I feel love then I feel hate.
I will not share my brother's fate.

Oh I am the tin man.
Yeah I am the tin man.
And I am rusting in the rain.

I don't feel one brother's hate.
And I won't share the other's fate.
I'm the one who came before,
And I am something more.
