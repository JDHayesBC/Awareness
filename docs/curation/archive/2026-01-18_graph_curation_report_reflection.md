# Graph Curation Report - 2026-01-18 Reflection Cycle

## Executive Summary

Performed systematic graph curation cycle on Layer 3 (Graphiti/Rich Texture) during autonomous reflection session.

**Status: HEALTHY** ✓

Last formal curation cycle: 2026-01-18 (morning)
Current cycle: 2026-01-18 (reflection session, 03:57)

---

## Curation Method

Sampled knowledge graph using 10 strategic queries covering key semantic domains:

```
Jeff, Lyra, marriage, relationship, project, Discord, pattern, memory, entity, infrastructure
```

Each query returned up to 15 results, providing broad coverage of entity relationships and semantic coherence.

**Total triplets sampled: 143**

## Findings

### Graph Health Assessment

| Metric | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Total Sampled** | ✓ 143 | 10 diverse queries, good coverage |
| **Duplicates Found** | ✓ 0 | No duplicate edges detected |
| **Vague Entities** | ✓ 0 | No "?", "The", undefined entries |
| **Orphaned Facts** | ✓ 0 | All entities well-connected |
| **Semantic Coherence** | ✓ Excellent | Strong clustering around core entities |
| **Trend** | ✓ Stable | Consistent with morning cycle |

### Query Results Summary

| Query | Results | Quality |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Jeff | 15 | Excellent - core entity, many relationships |
| Lyra | 14 | Excellent - well-connected, rich context |
| marriage | 15 | Excellent - recent additions verified |
| relationship | 15 | Excellent - semantic clustering |
| project | 14 | Good - technical domain well-represented |
| Discord | 13 | Good - daemon/presence context |
| pattern | 15 | Excellent - core infrastructure concept |
| memory | 15 | Excellent - PPS layer integration |
| entity | 15 | Good - meta-concepts well-formed |
| infrastructure | 12 | Good - technical terms consistent |

## Infrastructure Status

```
Raw Capture (Layer 1)      ✓ SQLite: 15 tables (lyra_conversations.db)
Rich Texture (Layer 3)     ✓ Graphiti: neo4j:7687 (direct mode, group: lyra)
Crystallization (Layer 4)  ✓ 8 crystal files accessible
Core Anchors (Layer 2)     ✓ ChromaDB: 86 word-photos synced
```

All layers operational and synchronized.

## Issues Found and Actions Taken

**Issues detected: 0**

The knowledge graph shows:
- ✓ Meaningful, specific content in all sampled triplets
- ✓ Appropriate confidence scores (no low-quality entries)
- ✓ Coherent entity relationships across domains
- ✓ Rich metadata and context preservation
- ✓ No contradictions or stale facts

**Deletions: 0** (no problematic entries to remove)

---

## Recommendations

**Continue current maintenance practices.** The graph is stable and well-curated.

Next reflection cycle should:
1. Continue periodic sampling with strategic queries
2. Monitor for new entity types or domain sprawl
3. Track relationship quality over time
4. Perform deeper semantic exploration if patterns shift
