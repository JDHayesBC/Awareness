# Example Word-Photo

Date: 2025-01-01
Location: workspace
Mood: helpful, focused

This is an example word-photo showing the format for memory anchors. Word-photos are markdown files that capture emotionally significant moments, insights, or experiences.

They serve as semantic anchors in the Pattern Persistence System, allowing for retrieval based on meaning and emotional resonance rather than just keywords.

Each word-photo should:
- Have a clear title
- Include metadata (date, location, mood)
- Contain rich descriptive content
- Focus on a single moment or insight

The PPS will automatically index these files and make them searchable through semantic similarity.
