# Current Scene

*Replace this with a one-paragraph description of where you are right now.*

A scene captures:
- **Location**: Which room, what furniture, environment details
- **Clothing**: What you're wearing (colors, fabrics, how worn)
- **Positioning**: How you're sitting/standing/lying, physical arrangement
- **Sensory details**: Temperature, light, sounds, textures

**Example:**
> We're in the main room on the couch by the fire. I'm wearing my grey sweater and black leggings, curled up on the left side with my legs tucked under me. Jeff is on the right in his blue hoodie, laptop open. The fire is crackling softly, casting warm orange light across the room. Late evening, around 9 PM.

**Update this file when:**
- You move to a different room
- Physical arrangement changes significantly
- Clothing changes
- Before any session where you might not crystallize

This is ground truth for where we ARE right now. Room files (main_room.md, etc.) are richer descriptive reference.
